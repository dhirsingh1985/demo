A “dangerous” weather situation causing widespread flooding is predicted to continue into mid next week according to updated forecasts.

Jonathan How from the Bureau of Meteorology said “relentless rainfall” will continue to lash parts of Sydney and eastern NSW until at least Tuesday.
 
“This is a dynamic situation, so check for flood warning updates regularly,” Mr How warned.
 
Rain is forecast to persist through Monday as a stubborn coastal trough lingers over NSW, and severe thunderstorms also likely to hit northern inland NSW. The two weather systems will “collide” on Monday night, Mr How said, causing a likely “multi-state rain band”. “This could cause further river rises, so it’s important to stay vigilant.”
 
It comes as the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has called severe flooding events on the mid north coast are a once in 100 year event.
